BENEFIT: Asthma sufferers have reported gaining relief from their symptoms through the practice of Vastra Dhauti. This yoga practice acts directly on the digestive system, which is believed to have a positive impact on the congestion in the lungs. By activating nerve reflexes in the digestive tract and brain, Vastra Dhauti may bring about a relaxation of the congestion, leading to improved breathing.

INSTRUCTIONS: To practice Vastra Dhauti for asthma relief, follow these steps:
1. Start by taking a clean, thin strip of cotton cloth (around 2 inches wide and 15-20 inches long).
2. Wet the cloth with clean water and squeeze out any excess moisture.
3. Stand in a comfortable position, ensuring your spine is straight.
4. Tilt your head slightly backward and open your mouth.
5. Take one end of the cloth and gently insert it into your mouth, pushing it back into your throat.
6. Using your index finger, softly guide the cloth down your throat until you feel a mild gag reflex.
7. Once you feel the gag reflex, gently pull the cloth out of your mouth, ensuring it doesn't touch your throat or tonsils.
8. Rinse the cloth with clean water and repeat the process 5-10 times, gradually increasing the number of repetitions over time.
9. After each round, spit out any phlegm or mucus that may have been dislodged.

Please note that it's important to practice Vastra Dhauti under the guidance of a qualified yoga instructor, especially if you are new to this technique.
